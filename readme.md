This is a buildpack for Heroku that installs a private github repo using environment variables (Config Vars) in Heroku for the username and Personal Access Token (PAT).

This is intended to be run after the Python buildpack

Confirmed working!!!

Many unsuccessful other attempts.

Hopefully this will help others that are having the same issue
